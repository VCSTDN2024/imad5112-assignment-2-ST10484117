Project Overview
The [FlashCardApp] is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [IMAD5111] subject. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio. The app's primary purpose is designed to help users study using a quiz format.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

Purpose and Features
Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to is to help users study with flashcards. The app presents a series of true/false questions, allows users to answer them, and provides feedback on their answers. It also calculates and displays the user's score at the end of the quiz.

Key Features:
Feature 1: True/False Flashcard Quiz: The app presents users with a series of True/False questions, allowing them to test their knowledge on a particular subject.
Feature 2: Score Tracking and Feedback: The app tracks the user's performance by counting correct answers and provides feedback, such as "Correct!" or "Incorrect!" for each question, and a summary score at the end.
Feature 3: Review Capability: Users can review the questions and the correct answers after completing the quiz, enabling them to reinforce their learning.
These features aim to provide users with a simple and effective way to test their knowledge and learn through a digital flashcard quiz.

Design Considerations
The design of the FlashCardApp was based on the following key considerations:

User Experience (UX): The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.

Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.

Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

GitHub Actions:
I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

Running automated tests to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
